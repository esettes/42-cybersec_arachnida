What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThere are documented issues for Hydra+DDP  in #11300 and #2727.   This PR attempts to fix these issues by redefining how a process is spawned when Hydra is used.\r\n\r\nFixes #11300\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrent approach is defined here: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/fe34bf2a653ebd50e6a3a00be829e3611f820c3c/pytorch_lightning/strategies/ddp.py#L233\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue of running with Hydra `multirun`.  For example, lets say we have the following Hydra app:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@hydra.main(config_path=None, config_name=\"myconfig\", version_base=\"1.1\")\r\ndef task_fn(cfg):\r\n    trainer = Trainer(gpus=2, strategy=\"ddp\")\r\n    model = BoringModel()\r\n    trainer.fit(model)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    task_fn()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can execute a `multirun` job with this app using the following command:\r\n```bash\r\npython script.py foo=1,2 --multirun\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will attempt to launch 2 jobs sequentially: one with `foo=1` and one with `foo=2`. For the first job, `foo=1`, PL launchers a normal job that begins execution while the second job is spawned with a subprocess using the following command derived from `sys.argv`:\r\n```bash\r\npython script.py foo=1,2 --multirun hydra.run.dir=
<os_cwd>
 hydra.job.name=train_ddp_process_
 <local_rank>
  \r\n```\r\nThis will spawn a new `mutlirun` job instead of running a normal job with `foo=2`. The command should be\r\n```bash\r\npython script.py foo=2 hydra.run.dir=
  <os_cwd>
   \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nEvery Hydra process will save the reproducible configuration of the job in a `config.yaml` file located in the `hydra.output_subdir`  experiment directory.  Using Hydra's CLI, we can execute the app with same configuration as the current experiment by defining `--config_path, -cp` and `--config_name, -cn`:\r\n```bash\r\npython script.py -cp
   <path dir="" hydra="" output="" to="">
    -cn config.yaml hydra.run.dir=
    <os_cwd>
     \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `config.yaml` contains the value for `foo` appropriate for the current `multirun` job.  I've outlined the support for `multirun`, but this should support any Hydra application launched from the command line.\r\n\r\n### Lingering Issue Not Solved\r\n\r\nIn order to run `multirun` on a local machine the user must add additional code to their task function before launching the next job.  This code, shown below, will destroy all distributed processes and remove PL related environment variables.  Without this code the `multirun` job will hang after the first job.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@hydra.main(config_path=None, config_name=\"myconfig\", version_base=\"1.1\")\r\ndef task_fn(cfg):\r\n    trainer = Trainer(gpus=2, strategy=\"ddp\")\r\n    model = BoringModel()\r\n    trainer.fit(model)\r\n    trainer.test(model)\r\n\r\n    # Need to do this in addition to Lightning shutting down the\r\n    # distributed processes in order to run a multirun loop with hydra\r\n    if dist.is_initialized():\r\n        dist.destroy_process_group()\r\n\r\n    os.environ.pop(\"LOCAL_RANK\", None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Thoughts\r\n\r\nThis solution should help most people, but IMHO the current method of spawning using `sys.argv` is not robust.  It would be nice to be able to execute a PL application similar to how I implemented the Hydra solution.  This would require dynamically creating a configurations for the application. The use of `save_hyperparameters` is nice but is only done inside the creation of a `LightningModule`, it would be nice to create a description of the model at a higher level — outside of the module. By defining the description outside of the module, one could use a similar approach as the Hydra solution above for PL applications.   I would recommend taking a look at [hydra-zen](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen) (FYI, I'm a contributor). \r\n\r\n### Does your PR introduce any breaking changes?
